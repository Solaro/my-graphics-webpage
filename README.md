A Website Demonstrating Interactive Graphics From THREE.js

From the Udacity 3D Interactive Graphics class I learned how to use the THREE.js library to 
render 3D graphics. Although I have obtained an understanding of the library and 3D graphics,
most of the programming was done within Udacity's website.

I decided to take what I learned from my other webdevelopment classes 
to create a websites that displays various 3D graphic models. This itself
took a while to accomplish. 

Here is the website:

Using:

I was finally able to have a 3D-template that I wanted to work with on my website. 

I started adding additional 3D-objects to website, but this is still a work in progress.
