A Website Demonstrating Interactive Graphics From THREE.js

From the Udacity 3D Interactive Graphics class I learned how to use the THREE.js library to 
render 3D graphics. Although I have obtained an understanding of the library and 3D graphics,
most of the programming was done within Udacity's website.

I decided to take what I learned from my other webdevelopment classes 
to create a websites that displays various 3D graphic models. This itself
took a while to accomplish. 

Here is the website: 

http://tkuo-website.appspot.com/

Using:

I was finally able to have a 3D-template that I wanted to work with on my website. 

I started adding additional 3D-objects to website, but this is still a work in progress.

Additional information:
Spinning Box: You can control how fast the box rotates using the top right panel

Spinning Sphere: You can control how fast the sphere rotates using the top right panel

Wire + Transparent Sphere: Click and interact with screen! You can also zoom in out.

Suprise me: Suprise.
